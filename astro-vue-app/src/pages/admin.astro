<Layout title="Admin Panel - Pokemon Manager">
  <!--
    IMPORTANT: This entire admin panel is ONE large island component.

    In Astro, islands are isolated - they cannot share state with each other.
    For complex admin UIs where multiple components need to share state
    (search, filters, table, selection), we must use a SINGLE island.

    This is a key limitation of Astro's islands architecture:
    - Simple interactivity: Multiple small islands work great
    - Complex shared state: Requires one large island

    Compare this to Nuxt/Next.js where all components can share state
    through Vue/React's context or state management.
